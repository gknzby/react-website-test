                I've loved problem solving for as long as I can remember. The harder a problem is, the more fun it has been for me to solve it. When I became an engineer, I took advantage of this. My favorite aspect of studying engineering is always the possibility that you may encounter a problem that you have never faced before.
                <br/> <br/>
                On the other hand, I do not agree with the prejudices about engineers being "asocial". I am a person who loves meeting new people and enjoys being in many different social environments. I have always been the person taking control of the group and managing the project in project groups at school.
                <br/> <br/>
